# Machine learning defined

Machine learning evolved from scientific pursuits in statistics, computer science, information theory, artificial intelligence, and pattern recognition.  

How to define machine learning?  
1) **Generally:** algorithms, computers, and other machines that can "learn" without direct input from a human programmer.  
2) **Practically:** sets of tools for investigating/modeling/understanding data.  
3)  **Specifically:** (see below)

# Supervised machine learning

Selecting a machine learning algorithm depends on the characteristics of the problem being investigated - there is no "best" method applicable to all cases. Machine learning is generally divided into three broad classes of learning: [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning), [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning), and [reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning). We will begin with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Lasso regression, followed by tree-based and ensemble classification methods. 

The syntax for supervised machine learning algorithms can be thought of like this:  

`\(Y\)` ~ `\(X_{1}\)` + `\(X_{2}\)` + `\(X_{3}\)`… `\(X_{n}\)`

`\(Y\)` is the dependent/response/target/outcome variable  
`\(X\)` are the independent/input/predictor/feature/covariate variables  

Supervised machine learning methods learn a target function `\(f\)` that best maps `\(X\)` to `\(Y\)` based on a set of [training data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_test,_and_validation_sets). 

---

# Supervised machine learning

Our function would look like this: `\(y = f(X) + \epsilon\)` where `\(f\)` is some function that relates our `\(X\)` predictor variables to `\(Y\)` in an unknown way thus we must estimate it. Epsilon `\(\epsilon\)` is the random error, is independent of `\(X\)` and averages to zero. Therefore, we can predict `\(Y\)` using `\(\hat{y} = \hat{f}(X)\)` for new data (the [test dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets)) and evaluate how well the algorithm learned the target function when introduced to new data.  

**How to define machine learning, specifically? (revisited)**  
More specifically, we can think of machine learning as a bunch of methods to estimate `\(f\)`!  

---

# Classification or regression?

**Classification** is used when the `\(Y\)` outcome variable is categorical/discrete. Binary examples generally refer to a yes/no situation where a 1 is prediction of the "yes" category and 0 as the "no". Classification models the probability that the outcome variable is 1 based on the covariates: `\(Pr(Y = 1 | X)\)`. This can be extended to multi-level classification as well.  

**Regression** is used when the target `\(Y\)` outcome variable is continuous. Regression models the conditional expectation (conditional mean) of the outcome variable given the covariates: `\(E(Y | X)\)`.  

---

# Data preprocessing

A longstanding first step is to split a dataset into **"training"** and **"test"** subsets. A training sample usually consists of a majority of the original dataset so that an algorithm can learn the model. The remaining portion of the dataset is designated to the test sample to evaluate model performance on data the model has not yet seen. **Missing data should be handled** before the splitting process commences.  

---

# Model performance

**Performance metrics** are used to see how well a model predicts a specified outcome on training and test datasets.  

A model that performs poorly on the training dataset is **underfit** because it is not able to discern relationships between the `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` variables.  

A model that performs well on the training dataset but poorly on the test dataset is said to be **overfit** because the model performed worse than expected when given new data. To some extent the patterns found in the training data may have been random noise and therefore, by random chance, are different in the test data.  

---

# Common performance metrics

- Accuracy  
- Mean squared error  
- Sensitivity and specificity  
- Area under the ROC curve (AUC)

# Specific workshop goals

Use the  `PimaIndiansDiabetes2` dataset from the [`mlbench` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlbench/mlbench.pdf) to investigate the following questions:  

1) **Lasso regression example:** How well can a person's age be predicted using the other diabetes-related variables?  

2) **Binary classification examples:** How reliably can different algorithms predict a person's diabetes status using the other variables?  

### Open "2-preprocessing.Rmd" to get started with the data.

# Data preprocessing

A first task will be to split our data into training and test sets. This not only allows us to build a model on training data and evaluate its performance on test/holdout data, but it is also a good way to get familiar with cross-validation. 

The short version is that we need to:  
1. Define `\(Y\)` outcome and `\(X\)` predictor variables  
2. Remove `\(Y\)` variable from `\(X\)` predictor datasets  
3. Handle missing data (if present)  
4. Scale data (if necessary)  
5. Convert factors to indicators (if necessary)  
6. Define training and test datasets  

---

# Cross-validation

[Cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics%29) is a way to measure model performance of an entire dataset by repeating the splitting process _k_ number of times then combining/averaging performance across all iterations.

# What is regression? 

Regression analysis is a technique to infer the relationship between a `\(Y\)` outcome variable and `\(X\)` predictor variable(s) and how much `\(Y\)` changes when `\(X\)` is altered. 

This algorithm ["regresses"](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/207425/why-do-we-say-the-outcome-variable-is-regressed-on-the-predictors/207621) `\(Y\)` onto `\(X\)`. In simpler terminology we want to see how our `\(X\)` variables can be used to predict `\(Y\)` for this example. 

Regression allows us to ask useful questions of our data, such as: 
1. Is there a relationship between `\(Y\)` and `\(X\)` variables? 
2. How strong are these relationships? 
3. How can `\(Y\)` be predicted for certain values of `\(X\)`? 
4. How well can the model be used to predict `\(Y\)` when new data are used? 

Simple (one `\(Y\)` and one `\(X\)` variable) linear (relationship between parameters being estimated) regression can be thought of as the simplest form of supervised machine learning and can be used for both prediction and inference. 

---

# Regression syntax

The syntax for simple regression looks like this: `\(Y = β0 + β1X + ε\)` 

`\(Y\)` = dependent/response/target/outcome variable  
`\(X\)` = independent/input/predictor/feature/covariate variables  
`\(β0\)` = intercept  
`\(β1X\)` = slope for that particular feature  
epsilon  `\({\epsilon}\)` = error  

Remember that in multivariate regression, there is more than one `\(X\)` variable. 

---

# Ordinary least squares example

[Ordinary least squares (OLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) regression is the simplest use case when the target `\(Y\)` variable is continuous. OLS computes a best fit line that minimizes the vertical squared and summed distances from each point to calculate the model's goodness of fit. Our refresher example will predict age from the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) (abbreviated as "pidd") using the other variables as predictors.  

[Mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) are quick ways to evaluate performance. MSE measures the difference between observed and expected values, with smaller values indicative of greater predictive accuracy. The advantage of RMSE is that it can be easier to interpret and explain because it is on the same unit scale as the outcome variable we are predicting. 

Remember that under the hood, [`lm`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.2/topics/lm) is one-hot encoding factors to indicators, but [`model.matrix`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.2/topics/model.matrix) was already manually used to do so.  

Also be sure to [check out this blog post](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/r-lm-summary.html) on how to fit and interpret linear models.

# Lasso

[Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics%29) is a form of variable selection regression that applies penalization to the coefficients through sparsity. It shrinks coefficients of the features that are not related to the outcome variable to zero, thus removing them to provide an ostensibly simpler model for interpretation.  

Sparsity: "Loosely speaking, a sparse statistical model is one in which only a relatively small number of parameters (or predictors) play an important role." (Hastie et al. 2016:1) aka a subset of the original variables. 

---

# Lasso

Lambda `\(\lambda\)` is the regularization coefficient, or the degree to which the beta coefficients should be penalized.  

When `\(\lambda\)` is zero, ordinary least squares regression is performed. 

Alpha `\(\alpha\)` determines the type of model; 1 indicates lasso penalty, 0 indicates ridge penalty, and anything inbetween indicates elastic net.  

### Open "3-lasso.Rmd" to work through the regression examples. 

---

# Decision trees

Decision trees are a standard alternative to linear regression and make no assumptions about the data; they split the data into smaller and smaller subgrioups of `\(X\)` covariates in terms of `\(Y\)` and split on each predictor. How does it work? 

A decision tree predicts that an observation belongs to its correct class. 

For basic classification, we are no longer using MSE or RMSE but instead classification error rate. 

To determine the top split ("root node"), the model looks at all cutpoints to see which group stands out as the best split. The "complexity parameter" can be used to [prune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_pruning) the tree to a lesser number of splits and removes unnecessary information.
